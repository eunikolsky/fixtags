## fixtags.py

It's a python script that fixes podcasts' MP3 tags after downloading the podcasts with [gPodder](http://gpodder.org/). The fixes are required for Sansa Sandisk Clip+ players to display the podcasts properly.

Requirements to run:

* [gPodder](http://gpodder.org/)

* [python 3](http://python.org/download/releases/)

* [stagger library](http://code.google.com/p/stagger/)

**NB:** Due to the vast difference in filling in of podcasts' tags, the script processes only the podcasts it knows about and has fixes for.

More detailed info on how to use the script is here: [http://www.egeek.me/2011/05/30/sandisk-sansa-clip-podcasts-gpodder/](http://www.egeek.me/2011/05/30/sandisk-sansa-clip-podcasts-gpodder/).
